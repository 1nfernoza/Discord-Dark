	A Github Dark Theme for Discord
	
	Maintained by: SyndiShanX
	Inspired by: Github Dark
	This Theme is meant to be used with Discord Dark Mode
	
	Installation:
	Copy discorddark.theme.css into your Better Discord Themes Folder
	
	Note:
	You may have to mess with the Icons in the css file depending on which plugins you have and which settings you have changed
	Open discorddark.theme.css and edit the numbers in parentheses on lines 42-78
	You can add More Icons for extra menus by copying a line, uploading an image to an image hosting site (Imgur)
	(There are some extra ones in the file and in the Imgur Album), changing the link to the image source, then editing the number
